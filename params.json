Its a centralized place for all of our data feeds, trip histories, our Data Use Policy, and links to some useful third-party bike share related libraries and tools.\r\n\r\n### **Data Use Policy**\r\n\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n### **Technical Details**\r\n\r\n*   Our feeds generally update once every minute. Please don't hit any one of them more often than that.\r\n*   Older feeds are in [XML](http://www.w3.org/XML//) format, the newer ones are in [JSON](http://www.json.org/) format.\r\n*   Each feed has an internal timestamp, use it to determine when the data was generated. The XML feeds use 13-digit unix timestamps including miliseconds.\r\n*   Every public station is listed in the feed with its lat/lon values. Sometimes an address, landmark, or city is also included.\r\n*   The feed includes how many bicycles and docks are available at each station.\r\n*   Each station has an unique ID (id) that should never change.\r\n\r\n### **Systems & Data Feeds**\r\n\r\n*   [Melbourne Bikeshare](http://www.melbournebikeshare.com.au/ \"http://www.melbournebikeshare.com.au/\") - Melbourne, AU\r\n    *   [XML Station Feed](http://www.melbournebikeshare.com.au/sites/default/files/XML/stations.xml \"http://www.melbournebikeshare.com.au/sites/default/files/XML/stations.xml\")\r\n*   [Capital Bikeshare](http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data \"http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data\") - Washington, DC; Arlington and Alexandria, VA; Montgomery County, MD\r\n    *   [XML Station Feed](http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/data/stations/bikeStations.xml \"http://www.capitalbikeshare.com/data/stations/bikeStations.xml\")\r\n    *   [Trip History](http://capitalbikeshare.com/trip-history-data \"http://capitalbikeshare.com/trip-history-data\")\r\n*   [Hubway](http://thehubway.com/ \"http://thehubway.com/\") - Boston-Metro, MA\r\n    *   [XML Station Feed](http://www.thehubway.com/data/stations/bikeStations.xml \"http://www.thehubway.com/data/stations/bikeStations.xml\")\r\n*   [Bike Chattanooga](http://www.bikechattanooga.com/ \"http://www.bikechattanooga.com/\") - Chattanooga, TN\r\n    *   [JSON Station Feed](http://www.bikechattanooga.com/stations/json \"http://www.bikechattanooga.com/stations/json\")\r\n*   [Citi Bike](http://citibikenyc.com/ \"http://citibikenyc.com/\") - New York City, NY\r\n    *   [JSON Station Feed](http://www.citibikenyc.com/stations/json \"http://www.citibikenyc.com/stations/json\")\r\n*   [Divvy Bikes](http://divvybikes.com/ \"http://divvybikes.com/\") - Chicago, IL\r\n    *   [JSON Station Feed](http://www.divvybikes.com/stations/json \"http://www.divvybikes.com/stations/json\")\r\n*   [CoGo Bikeshare](http://cogobikeshare.com/ \"http://cogobikeshare.com/\") - Columbus, OH\r\n    *   [JSON Station Feed](http://www.cogobikeshare.com/stations/json \"http://www.cogobikeshare.com/stations/json\")\r\n*   [Bay Area Bike Share](http://bayareabikeshare.com/ \"http://bayareabikeshare.com/\") - Bay Area, CA\r\n    *   [JSON Station Feed](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/stations/json \"http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/stations/json\")\r\n*   [Bike Share Toronto](http://www.bikesharetoronto.com/ \"http://www.bikesharetoronto.com/\") - Toronto, ON\r\n    *   [XML Station Feed](http://www.bikesharetoronto.com/data/stations/bikeStations.xml \"http://www.bikesharetoronto.com/data/stations/bikeStations.xml\")\r\n    *   [JSON Station Feed](http://www.bikesharetoronto.com/stations/json \"http://www.bikesharetoronto.com/stations/json\")\r\n\r\n### **Community Contributions**\r\n\r\nAlta Bicycle Share, Inc. does not support any libraries, code, or data contained in any of the links in this section.
